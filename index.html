					<p class="gameContainer_title">Asteroids Too</p>
					<p class="gameContainer_description">
						Asteroids Too was originally a game I made as an extra credit project for a
						python class I took in college. After spending a week developing it, I was
						rewarded with a perfect score for the assignment.<br />
						After that, I figured it was too fun a project to abandon immediately, so
						I decided that I would work on it for a bit longer. After adding a few new
						effects, sounds, and optomizations, I figured it was time to move on. <br />
						I feel this game is important for me to showcase because it was written in
						a language that was never meant to be used to create games like this with,
						yet I did it, in a fairly efficient and optomized way, utilizing a library
						called <a href="./">PyGame</a>.
